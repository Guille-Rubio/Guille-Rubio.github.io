                <h2>Theoretical framework
                </h2>
                <p><span class="names">Andrea Rosales Climent</span> analyses various cultural products within a
                    theoretical framework concerning
                    these perspectives: unfair practices, practices against user interest, hidden information,
                    illegitimate manipulative personalization, the exploitation of users’ vulnerability, the right to
                    equal treatment and the right to be treated with dignity.</p>
                <p>The expert analyses the imaginaries about automation and algorithmic systems in two cultural
                    products. Automation imaginaries are already embroidered in culture. Writers, journalists and
                    documentalists contribute to the construction of the related imaginaries and, at the same time,
                    embed the imaginaries of the society in their products. I particularly analyse two best-seller
                    books:
                </p>
                <ul class="book-styled-list">
                    <li>Uncanny Valley, by <span class="names">Anna Wiener</span></li>
                    <li>Quality Land, by <span class="names">Marc-Uwe Kling</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Uncanny Valley shows the techno-optimism of most tech workers who are not aware or are not interested
                    in being aware, of the potential social implications of the technologies they develop. The author
                    shows how tech culture contributes to creating this believer team, where employees are Down for the
                    cause of the project, and any critical view is disregarded. In the book<span class="names">
                        Wiener</span> shares her memoirs as
                    a misfit employed of the <span class="bold">Silicon Valley</span>. A privileged standpoint to observe the
                    culture of the tech
                    companies in the <span class="bold">Silicon Valley</span>.</p>
                <p>Throughout the book, the author reflects on the moral implications of data collection and
                    manipulation among technology companies:</p>
                <div>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Silicon Valley might have promoted a style of individualism, but scale bred
                            homogeneity </p>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The tech culture in <span class="bold">Silicon Valley</span> is very much part of the worker’s imagery. <span
                        class="names">Rosales</span> pointed out
                    that most tech workers are not interested in dealing with data ethics problems and are totally into
                    the techno-optimistic approach. This means that there is a general belief among workers that
                    technological developments will do more good for humanity than harm, that the solution to people’s
                    problems lies in technological innovation, and that they are actually the ones solving these
                    problems.
