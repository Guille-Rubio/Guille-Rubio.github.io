- `#F3F5F5` for the background colour of the page body. => This color has been modified to a Color with higher contrast to highlight main content. A lighter gray could have been used as well to improve contrast.
- `#0D7963` for the background colour of the navigation menu and for the background colour of the footer => This color has been changed for a lighter color to be used as background so it has a better contrast with the content.
- `#3AA992` for the background colour applied to the link corresponding to the current page in the navigation menu. This colour is also used in the gradient that appears in the boxes framing block quotes. => This color was kept as basis for the site to look for other colors with better contrast
- `#CCECE6` for the text of the navigation menu links.=> This color has been changed for a darker color for better contrast with the lighter background.
- `#790C22` for the text of the navigation menu links when hovering over them.=> This color has been changed for a color with better contrast. 
- `#FF0000` for people's names. => The use of this color has been omitted as it is not accesible for color-blind users, important text has been highlighted with underlining and bold.


Text stroke for h2 has been omitted for the issues with red text described before. 

Blockquotes had its text changed to a darker font for better contrast. 



I think it would be advisable to choose another base color other than green.
