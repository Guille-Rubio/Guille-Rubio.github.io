                <h2>Data and algorithms</h2>
                <p>The Data Society Research Seminar: Behind Data and Algorithms – Actors, logics and cultures behind
                    digital technologies took place last week on 16 June at <span class="bold">Malmö University</span>.
                    There to speak at the
                    event were <span class="names">Andrea Rosales Climent</span> and <span class="names">Sara
                    Suárez-Gonzalo</span> , researchers from the <span class="bold">IN3</span>. The seminar
                    was organized by <span class="bold">Malmö University’s Data Society research
                    programme</span>.</p>
                <p>Data and algorithms are intensively put in the public eye and have been on the research agenda for
                    some time, prompting studies on biased systems regarding gender, ethnicity and now age. Researching
                    the actors, logic and cultures behind data can lead academics to key insights into how algorithms
                    embody rules, furthering discussions on power in today’s data society.</p>
                <p>Over the last 20 years, digital technology and the internet have completely changed our mindsets. The
                    internet was initially seen as a new world of amazing capabilities, but the digital revolution now
                    threatens to undermine values such as personal freedom, democracy, trustworthy knowledge and even
                    open competition. The future looks more like a dystopian universe than a utopian digital world.
                    Words like monopoly, surveillance and disinformation describe the most pressing problems in this
                    rather fearful internet setting. It sometimes feels like we live in a technological regime where our
                    privacy is not respected anymore. In order to have any hope of recovering the promise of new
                    technology, these problems need to be fixed</p>

                <h2>Data domination: the effects of mass surveillance</h2>
                <p><span class="names">Sara Suárez-Gonzalo</span> focused her talk on explaining how neo-republican
                    theory can help us to better
                    understand and deal with the effects of big data exploitation, mass surveillance and the way they
                    shape social power relations.
                </p>
                <p>The hegemonic framework for the discussion of the social and political effects of data-driven
                    technologies is the liberal conception of the values of privacy and freedom (traditionally defined
                    by liberalism as non-interference).</p>

                <h2>A new perspective</h2>
                <p>There is no control of privacy nowadays; this is seen in the need to accept cookies from regular
                    websites to do any daily task on a computer. Surveillance strips people of control over their
                    freedom to remain private, thus taking away their right to privacy. Overcoming data domination will
                    mean defying the liberal hegemonic conception of privacy and accepting that leaving people alone to
                    do as they please is not enough. We need to rethink a possible feminist and neo-republican
                    perspective. For that, <span class="names">Suárez-Gonzalo</span> proposed two conditions:</p>
                <ul class="earth-styled-list">
                    <li>Everyone must be provided with the material and immaterial resources necessary to keep the
                        potential forms of domination in check. This means guaranteeing universal education on digital
                        issues and bridging the digital divides affecting some parts of the population that are unable
                        to keep up with technological development.
                    </li>
                    <li>Structural conditions, such as restrictions of policy, that give control to big tech companies
                        must be avoided. This means preventing them from exercising their power on public institutions
                        and imposing restrictions on the monopolistic dynamics of the economy that guide the
                        technological business model.
                    </li>
                </ul>
